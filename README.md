This is a fast paced boomer shooter, developed my myself and Tiago Carvalho.

This repository is to archive the files for the latest build. 

## How to play the game
Download the latest build and run the ```SteampunkBoomer.exe``` file.
From there, play the tutorial first to get a grip on the controls.
Not mentioned in the tutorial, but, to pause the game at any point, press T.
